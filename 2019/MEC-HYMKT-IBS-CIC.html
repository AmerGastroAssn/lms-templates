                <!-- Description -->
                <p class="mt-1">Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) are common
                    disorders of bowel function, accounting for the largest diagnostic subgroups in gastroenterology
                    practices and representing more than 1 in 10 patients who present in primary care practices.
                    Regrettably, the heavy sociomedical burden and reduced quality of life associated with these
                    disorders are often compounded by late or inaccurate diagnosis and with inadequate or inappropriate
                    management. In response to the IBS in America survey, patients reported an average of four years to
                    an IBS diagnosis. In this series of programs, these challenges associated with diagnosis are
                    addressed, along with recommendations for evidence-based treatments that address the underlying
                    pathology of the IBS/CIC continuum, as well as practical suggestions for patient-centric care.</p>
                <p>Currently, only House
                    Call 1- Focus on Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Diarrhea (IBS-D) is available
                    for viewing and credit claiming. Please come back to AGA University as the
                    other sections of this activity will be available shortly.</p>
